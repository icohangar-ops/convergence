## The Problem

High-stakes financial decisions — mergers, capital raises, restructurings, IPOs — share a common failure mode: **decision opacity**. Teams build spreadsheets, run analyses, and present recommendations, but nobody can trace *why* a specific number landed where it did, *which assumptions were tested*, or *who validated the conclusion*.

Convergence solves this with a multi-agent decision pipeline wrapped in the **Consensus Hardening Protocol (CHP)** — ensuring every recommendation passes adversarial review, foundation disclosure, and explicit lock progression before it reaches the board.

---

## What Convergence Does

Convergence runs 3 agents per workstream through a **Cognitive Mesh** (expansion/compression reasoning) and **CHP decision governance** (EXPLORING → PROVISIONAL_LOCK → LOCKED):

```
Integration Mesh (3 agents per workstream)
    → Cognitive Mesh Protocol (expansion/compression reasoning)
    → Consensus Hardening Protocol (EXPLORING → PROVISIONAL_LOCK → LOCKED)
    → Convergence Dashboard (health, risks, milestones, decisions)
```

### Reference Implementation: M&A Integration

| Workstream | Finance Agent | Strategy Agent | Compliance Agent |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Chart of Accounts Mapping** | Account mapping, KPI alignment | Management view alignment | Restatement estimates |
| **Close Harmonization** | Close calendar, reconciliation gaps | Policy alignment | Audit readiness |
| **Systems Integration** | System dependency map, cutover risks | Migration plan | Security review |
| **Synergy Tracking** | Synergy pipeline, value capture | Risk register | Reporting controls |

### Extending to Other Scenarios

The same 3-agent-per-workstream architecture applies to:

- **Capital Raises** — investor targeting, valuation, term sheet analysis
- **Restructurings** — debt analysis, stakeholder impact, creditor negotiation
- **IPO Readiness** — S-1 drafting, SOX compliance, auditor coordination
- **Due Diligence** — financial, legal, operational, technology workstreams

## CHP Decision Flow

```
DecisionCase → R0 Gate (Solvable/Scoped/Valid/Worth_it)
    → Foundation Disclosure (1-3 weakest assumptions)
    → Foundation Attack (adversarial review)
    → Score >= 70? → EXPLORING → PROVISIONAL_LOCK → LOCKED (via 3rd-party validation)
    → Score < 70?  → REFRAME_REQUIRED
    → R0 fail?     → HALT
```

### Scoring

- **Overall Health**: RED (any workstream red) / AMBER (any amber) / GREEN (all green)
- **Foundation Score**: 0-100 (>= 70 to proceed, >= 100 for clean lock)
- **Accuracy Guard**: Floor enforcement — forces human verification below threshold

## Signed Audit Ledger

Every agent recommendation, board narrative, and stigmergy-board write is
recorded in a **tamper-evident, append-only JSONL ledger**
(`.convergence/audit.jsonl` by default), so the post-merger-integration
reasoning trail is defensible to an audit committee, external auditor, or
regulator.

**Scheme** (extracted from the signed-ledger family — cleanmandate,
swarmfi-executor, glacier-edge-arm, compliance-as-code-agent — and strengthened
with per-record signature chaining):

- One JSON record per line, append-only, never rewritten.
- Each record is signed as `HMAC-SHA256(key, canonical_json(record) + prev_sig)`,
  where `canonical_json` is the deterministic (sorted-key) encoding of every
  field except `sig`, and `prev_sig` is the signature of the previous line — so
  any edit, deletion, or reordering breaks the chain from the first tampered
  record onward.

**Record shape:** `{ts, event, actor, inputs, sources, confidence?, rationale?, prev_sig, sig}`

**Key:** read from `AUDIT_LEDGER_KEY` (a test default is used when unset so the
offline tests run without configuration — set a real secret in production).

```python
from convergence.audit import AuditLedger

ledger = AuditLedger("audit.jsonl")             # key from AUDIT_LEDGER_KEY
sig = ledger.append(event="recommendation", actor="finance",
                    inputs={"problem": "map coa"}, sources=["trial_balance"],
                    confidence="high", rationale="Map 1:1 where clean")
intact, first_tampered_index = ledger.verify()  # (True, None) when clean
```

The ledger is wired into `EnterpriseOrchestrator` by default — every turn and
the final board narrative are signed automatically.

## Stigmergic Coordination

Convergence coordinates ~12 mesh agents (four workstreams × three agents).
Rather than relaying every agent's full output to the next through the LLM,
agents can coordinate **stigmergically** — by depositing and reading compact
typed signals on a shared **SQLite board** whose signals **decay over time**.
Coordination reads/writes are pure arithmetic + SQL, so peer-to-peer
coordination costs **zero LLM tokens**.

Pattern adapted from **cubiczan-swarm-pack** (scent-field pheromones) and
**swarmfi-preps** (persistent SQLite stigmergy board).

**How it works**

- **deposit(region/key, kind, strength):** an agent posts a typed signal —
  `FINDING`, `RISK_FLAG`, `DEPENDENCY_NOTE`, or `CONFIDENCE`.
- **time decay:** each signal's live strength is
  `strength · e^(−λ·elapsed)` with `λ = ln(2) / half_life` (per-type
  half-lives; risk flags linger longest). Signals also carry a hard TTL.
- **read_signals(region):** returns live signals for a key/region, strongest
  (post-decay) first; `context_for(agent)` returns the compact board view that
  is injected into an agent's context **instead of** peer transcripts.
- **evaporate() / garbage_collect():** purges signals past TTL or decayed below
  the GC threshold.

**Non-breaking and topology-preserving.** Stigmergy is opt-in via a feature
flag; the existing Kahn topological producer→consumer ordering is unchanged. The
board only changes *how context flows between turns*.

```python
from convergence.mesh.orchestrator import EnterpriseOrchestrator

# Feature-flagged: agents coordinate via the board, not LLM chatter.
orch = EnterpriseOrchestrator(agents=ws.agents, context=ws.context,
                              use_stigmergy=True)
report = orch.orchestrate("Analyze CoA mapping")   # topo order preserved
```

Direct board use:

```python
from convergence.stigmergy import StigmergyBoard, SignalType

board = StigmergyBoard()
board.deposit(agent="finance", signal_type=SignalType.RISK_FLAG,
              key="coa", content="intercompany accounts unmapped", strength=1.0)
signals = board.read(key="coa")            # decayed, strongest first
board.garbage_collect()                     # evaporate expired signals
```
